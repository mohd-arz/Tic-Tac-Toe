# [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://mohd-arz.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/)

#### This Project was created only with vanilla HTML CSS JS, right after I learned about Factory Functions and Modules.

In this project, I started with SinglePlayer with Pc's only random move then I added Multiplayer later I added some lines to check Pc on the adjacent side and placemarks.

There are some repeatable codes for the Game Logic, but I've put my all to reduce repeatability with my current Knowledge.
